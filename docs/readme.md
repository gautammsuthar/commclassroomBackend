# Development Guide

# Entites 
Entities are "things" that we see in the project for example user, course, instructor, review, etc are all entities. Ideally all entities get a collection in the database.
 
## **User**
USER (or student in our case) is anyone who "uses" or logs into the system in order to view the content, and engage with it.

The following details are stored about the user:
- Personal details
  - email `string`
  - full name `string`
  - date of birth / year of birth `date`
  - gender `enum`
  - school / college / university name `string`
  - current education level - high school, under grad, grad, etc. `enum`
  - social accounts : `Array<{site: string, url:string}>`
  - profile photo `url`
  - details about account on platform
  - member since `date`
  - last logged in `date`
  - account status (blocked, suspended, verified, unverified) `enum`
  - account type (student, assistant, instructor, admin) `enum`
  - interation with entities
  - courses enrolled
    ```
    Array<{
      course: course.id, 
      enrolled: date,
      lastOpened: date,
      status : enum[enrolled, in progress, abondoned, completed]
      completeed: number
    }>
    ```
  - courses liked `Array<course.id>`
  - course assistant `Array<course.id>`
  - course teacher `Array<course.id>`
  - reviews `Array<review.id>`


## **Course**
Course is a sequential arrangement of **videos** on a similar context. Courses are just an abstraction of a collection of videos, so the schema is mainly metadata.

The following details are as follows:
- Course Details
  - title
  - category (web dev, app dev, cloud native, soft skills, ...)
  - instructors `Array<user.id>`
  - assistants `Array<user.id>`
  - students `Array<user:id>`
  - total likes `array<user.id>`
  - reviews `array<review.id>`
  - faq 
  ```
  array<{
    question: string, 
    answer: string, 
    author: user.id
  }>```


## **Review**
Reviews are an important part of offerings, and are required for further analysis.

The following details are stored about a review
  - public data of a review
  - rating `number`
  - author `user.id`
  - date published `date`
  - for course `course.id`
  - status `enum[visible, featured, blocked]`
  - upvotes/found helpful `array<user.id>`
